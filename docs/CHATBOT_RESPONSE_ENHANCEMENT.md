# Chatbot Response Enhancement - Dynamic Structured Formatting

## Overview

I've enhanced the Xavier AI chatbot to provide dynamic, structured responses based on the type of question asked. The chatbot now intelligently formats responses to be more readable and user-friendly.

## Key Features

### 1. **Question Type Detection**
The system automatically detects different types of questions:
- **List questions**: "What are the features?", "List all options"
- **Pricing questions**: "How much does it cost?", "What are your prices?"
- **Tutorial questions**: "How do I setup?", "Step by step guide"
- **Technical questions**: "Error", "Not working", "Bug"
- **Comparison questions**: "What's the difference?", "Compare X vs Y"
- **Contact questions**: "How to contact?", "Support phone number"
- **Feature questions**: "Does it support?", "What functionality?"
- **Account questions**: "Change password", "Account settings"

### 3. **Enhanced Frontend Display**

The frontend now includes:
- **Structured content detection**: Automatically detects when responses contain structured formatting
- **Rich formatting**: Headers, lists, bold text, and organized sections
- **Responsive design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile
- **Enhanced readability**: Better spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

### 4. **Improved LLM Prompting**

The LLM is now instructed to:
- Use appropriate formatting based on question type
- Structure responses with clear headers and sections
- Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate
- Bold important information
- Break up long text into readable sections
