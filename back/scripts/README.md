# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility and maintenance scripts for the Xavier AI backend.

## Purpose

These scripts are used for:
- Database migrations and fixes
- Development and testing utilities
- Maintenance operations
- One-time setup or update tasks

## Usage

Run scripts from the back/ directory root:
```bash
python scripts/script_name.py
```

Most scripts require the xavier_back package to be importable, so ensure you're running from the correct directory.
