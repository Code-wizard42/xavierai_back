# Back Directory Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

### Removed Duplicate Directories
- ✅ Removed root-level `flask_session/` (kept `xavier_back/flask_session/`)
- ✅ Removed root-level `instance/` (consolidated into `xavier_back/instance/`)
- ✅ Removed root-level `logs/` (kept `xavier_back/logs/` with more comprehensive logs)
- ✅ Removed root-level `migrations/` (empty, kept `xavier_back/migrations/` with actual migration files)
- ✅ Removed root-level `uploads/` (empty, kept `xavier_back/uploads/`)
- ✅ Consolidated `vector_db/` (moved newer data to `xavier_back/vector_db/`)

### Removed Development Artifacts
- ✅ Removed all `__pycache__/` directories
- ✅ Cleaned up temporary files and development artifacts

### Script Organization
- ✅ Created `scripts/` directory for utility scripts
- ✅ Added `scripts/README.md` for documentation
- ✅ Removed redundant `run.py` (kept `run_app.py` with better error handling)

### Added Documentation
- ✅ Created `back/README.md` with structure overview and usage instructions
- ✅ Created `.gitignore` to prevent future clutter
- ✅ Added `.gitkeep` to uploads directory
